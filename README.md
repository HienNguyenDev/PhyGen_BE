# PhyGen - AI-powered High School Physics Exam Generator (Backend)

**PhyGen** is a backend application powered by AI that automatically generates high school physics exam questions. Built with .NET using a clean architecture approach, this project is designed for scalability, modularity, and easy integration with frontend applications or mobile apps.

## 🚀 Features

- **Automatic Physics Exam Generation**: Generate physics exam questions based on selected chapters, cognitive levels, and difficulty.
- **Question Categorization**: Classify questions by chapter, topic, or skill level.
- **RESTful API**: Provides endpoints to interact with exam generation, question bank, and related features.
- **Docker Support**: Easy deployment with Docker and Docker Compose.

## 🧱 Architecture Overview

The project follows a clean layered architecture:

- `PhyGen.Api`: Main API layer handling HTTP requests and routing.
- `PhyGen.Application`: Contains business logic and use cases.
- `PhyGen.Domain`: Defines core domain entities and interfaces.
- `PhyGen.Infrastructure`: Implements domain interfaces (e.g., database access, external services like AI model integrations).

## ⚙️ Requirements

- [.NET 8 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)
- PostgreSQL

## 🛠️ Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HienNguyenDev/PhyGen_BE.git
cd PhyGen_BE
```

### 2. Run with Docker

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

### 3. Access the API

After launching, the API will be available at:

```
http://localhost:5000
```

You can test the endpoints using Swagger, Postman, or any API client.
